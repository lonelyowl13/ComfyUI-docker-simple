# ComfyUI-docker

Dockerfile for ComfyUI 

No automatic downloads of terabytes of models, no manager, no custom nodes, no nothing. It's just comfy. 
(I lied, there are some custom nodes defined in nodes_download.bash, you can delete them if you wish so)

Only works on nvidia (container uses cuda 12.6.1), for the sake of simplicity and because i have no other gpus.
